				<div class="dark">
					<p> Innovators developing groundbreaking medical device technologies face several challenges along the translational path 
						from bench to bedside. The NIH Blueprint MedTech: Incubator Hubs aim to address such challenges by accelerating the 
						development of cutting-edge medical devices to diagnose and treat disorders of the nervous system. This program will 
						catalyze the translation of novel neurotechnologies from early-stage development to pathway to a human-grade 
						prototype ready for first-in-human-testing and will provide: (a) non-dilutive funds to support medical device 
						development activities led by investigators, (b) ongoing, specialized support from experienced executive mentors and 
						(c) additional resources and support services including, but not limited to:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Resources to plan and support concept development, team building, needs assessment, and other early 
							translational activities.</li>
						<li>Assistance from Hubs and consultants (e.g., on design, regulatory, reimbursement, intellectual property, 
							commercialization, and strategic partnership issues).</li>
						<li>Other resources listed on the 
							<a href="https://neuroscienceblueprint.nih.gov/neurotherapeutics/blueprint-medtech/blueprint-medtech" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blueprint MedTech Website</a></li>
					</ul>
					<p>The Center for Innovative NeuroTech Advancement (CINTA) and NeuroTech Harbor (NTH) are two NIH-funded incubator Hubs that 
						will provide direct funding and in-kind resources to innovator teams. The objective of Hub support is to develop and 
						de-risk these groundbreaking technologies to the point where additional investments are warranted from industry 
						partners, investors, and government. By the conclusion of CINTA or NTH funding, it is anticipated that all projects 
						will have non-governmental funding secured or be ready for entry into the companion solicitations from NIH: </p>

						<h2>Funding Opportunity</h2>
					</div>
				</header>
				<div class="dark">
					<p>CINTA and NTH seek groundbreaking collaborative projects to improve the diagnosis and treatment of disorders of the 
						nervous system or their sequelae. The technologies proposed in applications must have a pathway to a prototype ready for first-in-human 
						testing within 4 years. If successful, projects should be viable candidates for commercial development or have a 
						viable and sustainable financial plan for rare disorders.
					</p>
					<p><b>Awards from NTH or CINTA will rarely exceed $500,000 in direct costs per year for a period of up to 4 years. </b>
						In addition to monetary support, awardees will receive ongoing, specialized support from mentors experienced in 
						commercializing medical devices. Awardees will work with their individual mentor for several hours each week to focus 
						on business, regulatory, clinical, and technical factors that may impede commercialization.  
					</p>
					<p>The Blueprint MedTech Hubs and NIH encourage applications from women, underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, as well 
						as individuals with disabilities.

						<h2>Review Process and Eligibility</h2>
					</div>
				</header>
				<div class="dark">
					<p>In response to this solicitation, applicants must submit pre-proposals, which will undergo review by CINTA, NTH, and NIH 
						program scientific staff. Pre-proposals are submitted through a simple online application form equivalent to 
						approximately 4 pages.
					</p>
					<p>A subset of the applicants who submit pre-proposals will be selected to submit full proposals which are submitted through 
						the same online application system. The online full proposal form is equivalent to approximately ten pages. A subset 
						of the applicants who submit full proposals will be selected to participate in a “deep dive” evaluation, which is the 
						final stage of review prior to funding decisions.
					</p>
					<p>Another subset of the applicants who submit full proposals will be invited to participate in the companion seedling 
						program and be awarded up to $50,000 total cost. The seedling program is akin to a planning grant that will provide 
						training and mentoring to help applicants refine the intended target product profile and regulatory and reimbursement 
						strategies in order to strengthen subsequent applications to the program. 
					</p>
					<p>Principal Investigators (PIs) from academic institutions, industry, and non-profit organizations are invited to apply. 
						Any individual(s) with the skills, knowledge, and resources necessary to carry out the proposed research as the 
						Principal Investigator(s) is (are) invited to work with their organization to develop and submit a proposal.
					</p>
					<p>Applicants should consider avenues to support diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility in their proposals. 
						This may be addressed by including team members or collaborators from groups that are traditionally underrepresented 
						in the translational workforce or by considering population factors such as racial and ethnic groups, gender, and 
						disabilities.  Proposals that address conditions or clinical indications where current diagnostic or treatment 
						options disproportionately fail to serve underrepresented populations are encouraged.  
					</p>
					<p>All pre-proposals, full proposals, and deep dive discussions will be conducted on a confidential basis.</p>

						<li>Include data showing that the diagnostic or therapeutic technology has already been demonstrated to address the 
							targeted indication <em>in silico</em> or <em>in vivo</em> (animal or human subjects) with enough confidence that the remaining 
							challenges are primarily related to building a commercializable prototype and demonstrating its safety and 
							effectiveness.</li>
						<li>Address at least one area of interest of the NIH Participating Organizations. Applicants are encouraged to 
							discuss their concept with the points of contact to ensure mission fit.</li>

							including underserved and vulnerable populations.</li>
					</ul>
					
					<h4>Applications will NOT be considered for:</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Device technologies that do not significantly advance the state of the art (e.g., device technology that proposes 
							minor modifications to FDA-approved/cleared medical device technology).</li>
						<li>Animal model development: all <em>in vivo</em> animal models must be well established and characterized, and 
							available to the applicant.</li>
						<li>Fundamental basic/applied research projects that employ existing market-approved devices for their labeled 
							uses.</li>
						<li>Projects focused on technologies for functional augmentation of healthy individuals.</li>
